What I did differently in my second attempt in this program was I used loops to make this program more concise. At first,the program would run by the colors having different variables and in the script.js file, it would be that if you click on this color then it would work. Over the course of this semester I was able grow my understanding of loops and functions. I had functions at first, but now I added loops in that function. In the function 'fillCanvas', I said if I click on a selectedColor(which is any of the colors) then it will change the color regardless of which color it is already using. Since, I was able to add this loop in my program, I was able to add more colors because if I need to add a color, I don't have to add any statements saying what to do when I click on this color. Along with adding more colors, I also added more boxes so there is more room to draw. When I first started coding this program, I had little to know understanding of loops, but now I am able to use loops to make sure my progam is more concise.
